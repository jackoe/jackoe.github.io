<h3>Twitter the night the NYT needle died</h3>

<p><strong>For the lost</strong>, the nytimes had a needle that would use a combination of previous polling, exit polling, and live results to try and generate up to the minute predictions of who would win. Vetrans of the site in Nov &#39;16 might remember this. It swung around in concert with the confidence the model had in its predictions. But the precious needle played with our hearts.</p>

<p>So I think we can all agree that the @UpshotNYT needle is the biggest winner tonight.</p>

<p>Me twenty minutes ago: Early results don&#39;t mean anything. I won&#39;t start watching them until later.</p>

<p>Alright folks, we&#39;ve shut the needle down. As mentioned earlier, Westmoreland County isn&#39;t going to produce precinct results, as we believed they would. It&#39;s the GOP base of the district. We can&#39;t responsibly make a forecast without data from there.</p>

<p>‚Äî Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) March 14, 2018</p>

<hr />

<p>If Westmoreland finishes its count, and the race is still uncalled, we&#39;ll try and turn it back on.</p>

<p>Glad to have outlived the needle.</p>

<p>Editor: What do you mean, you can&#39;t turn the needle off?</p>

<p>Cohn: It&#39;s... become self aware!</p>

<p>If this goes to recount, someone please just grab that broken NYT needle and aim directly for my eye</p>

<p>I can give up the needle any time. I don&#39;t need the needle. I&#39;m doing fine. I&#39;m not going through withdrawal. I&#39;m not thinking about the needle. Nope. Not at all. Good riddance I say. I don&#39;t need the needle. GIVE ME BACK MY NEEDLE.</p>

<p>I think what @Nate_Cohn and the NYT crew did in shutting down the &quot;needle&quot; tonight was very responsible and the right move to make, even though people will inevitably take shots at them. Sucks when your data feed breaks down, but they responded appropriately. Deserve credit.</p>
