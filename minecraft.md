The server of last year is back up; Rejoice! It will be up for the forseeable future.

### Quickstart
* use the latest version of minecraft (1.13)
* use the ip `108.51.203.201`
* use the nether portal to reach the main base.

### Sharing
Feel free to share IP with anyone who was origionally involved last year, and anyone who would know them who wants in.

### Technical
The server is running a development build of [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/). As such, bugs will show up occasionally. For example, minecarts are much much slower than they should be, dunno why. I'll update server as spigot releases new versions, making for more stability.

If you know how to work with spigot to make it more fun/reliable, let me know and I'll send you ssh credentials. I'm relatively in the dark here.
